## VCL Attendance Report to NocoDB - [Workflow](https://github.com/mimnets/n8n-automation-problem-solutions-workflows/blob/main/N8N-Workflows/VCL_Attendance_Report_Nocodb.json)
I have created this workflow on sel-hsoted n8n server to collect excel .xls data and then modify the data to upload to the self-hosted NocoDB server. So, that we can store the attendance report and use for later.

## VCL Attendance AI Agent - [Workflow](https://github.com/mimnets/n8n-automation-problem-solutions-workflows/blob/main/N8N-Workflows/VCL_Attendance_AI_Agent.json)
This AI Agent will help automatically generate attenadance everyday, if the excel reports uploaded to the Google Drive. And also use this Agent to generate or ask any qhuestions realted to attendance report.
